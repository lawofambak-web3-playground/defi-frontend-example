# DeFi Frontend Website Example

## Introduction
This is a basic frontend website template example for a dApp created using Next.js. For this template, I tried to mimic the [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) frontend website. I divided the page into different sections and then added some filler information to fill the sections such as protocol metrics, client testimonials, and a contact form. Functionality for this template is very limited as I mainly focused on how the frontend should look and be structured.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
